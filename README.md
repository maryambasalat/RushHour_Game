# RushHour_Game
Rush Hour is a game for one player, in which the player takes up the role of a taxi driver who must collect money by dropping passengers to their destinations. 

# Starter Code:
In this a starter code in C++ is used to draw circle, square and triangles of
different colors and sizes. I have added the logic in the starter code to implement the game functionality.

To execute the starter code, you need to do the following:
a) Open the terminal and navigate to the path of game directory
b) Install the required libraries by executing the command below:
bash install-libraries.sh
c) Compile the project by writing the command
make
d) Run the main file
./game
